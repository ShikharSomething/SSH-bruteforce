# SSH-bruteforce
This is a ssh bruteforce.
It asks for 3 things. Ip of target, username of target pc and a file containing all passwords file. All it does is test all the passwords in the password file on the target
machine and check which password is right. I am just uploading this for new and beginner ethical hackers and pentesters. I am also learning. :)
